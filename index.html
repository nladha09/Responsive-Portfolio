            <p>My name is Noreen Ladha. I have four years of Technical Project Management experience and was previously a tech consultant for PwC.</p>

            <p>I started my career in IT as simply an account manager for a small managed services startup, then got promoted to Project Manager.</p>

            <p>Working closely with the systems engineers and infrastructure guys on several projects, naturally, I wanted to get more technical so I could fully understand where the bottle necks, backlog, and technical debt lied.</p>

            <p>That ultimately led me to want to tinker and learn more about how I can be more efficient and automate tasks.</p>
